Apache Tajo (incubation)
========================
Tajo is a relational and distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.
Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc queries, online
aggregation and ETL on large-data sets by leveraging advanced database
techniques. It supports SQL standards. It has its own query engine which
allows direct control of distributed execution and data flow. As a result,
Tajo has a variety of query evaluation strategies and more optimization
opportunities. In addition, Tajo will have a native columnar execution and
and its optimizer.

Disclaimer
==========
Apache Tajo is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status
is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
