In this section, we explain setup of a standalone Tajo instance. It will run against the local filesystem. In later sections, we will present how to run Tajo cluster instance on Apache Hadoop's HDFS, a distributed filesystem. This section shows you how to start up a Tajo cluster, create tables in your Tajo cluster, submit SQL queries via Tajo shell, and shutting down your Tajo cluster instance. The below exercise should take no more than ten minutes.
