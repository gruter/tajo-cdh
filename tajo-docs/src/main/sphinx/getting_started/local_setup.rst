**********************************
Setting up a local Tajo cluster
**********************************

Apache Tajoâ„¢ provides two run modes: local mode and fully distributed mode. Here, we explain only the local mode where a Tajo instance runs on a local file system. A local mode Tajo instance can start up with very simple configurations.

First of all, you need to add the environment variables to conf/tajo-env.sh.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Hadoop home. Required
  export HADOOP_HOME= ...

  # The java implementation to use.  Required.
  export JAVA_HOME= ...

To launch the tajo master, execute start-tajo.sh.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ $TAJO_HOME/bin/start-tajo.sh

.. note::

  If you want to how to setup a fully distributed mode of Tajo, please see :doc:`/configuration/cluster_setup`.
